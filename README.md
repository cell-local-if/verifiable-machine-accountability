# Verifiable Machine Accountability

Backend foundation for recording, constraining, verifying, and auditing actions performed by automated systems. The service is designed to grow around machine identities, policy decisions, authorization, tamper-evident evidence, incident handling, responsibility attribution, audit queries, and compliance exports.

## Development

Requires Python 3.12 or newer.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[test]'
pytest -q
uvicorn accountability.app:app --reload
```

The initial API exposes `GET /health`, which returns a JSON readiness result.

## Authorization event integrity chain

Each machine's authorization decision events form a per-machine, tamper-evident
hash chain. Every event returned by the create and list endpoints carries:

- `previous_event_id` — `null` for the machine's first event, otherwise the id
  of the preceding event in `(created_at, id)` order;
- `content_hash` — `SHA-256(UTF-8(compact key-sorted JSON of {id, machine_id,
  action_type, resource, allowed, reason, created_at}))`;
- `chain_hash` — `SHA-256(UTF-8("" + ":" + content_hash))` for the first event
  and `SHA-256(UTF-8(previous_chain_hash + ":" + content_hash))` thereafter.

All hashes are 64-character lowercase hexadecimal strings. New events are
appended to the chain tail inside a single write transaction, so concurrent
writes cannot lose events, fork, or break the chain. On startup the service
adds the new columns to pre-existing databases and backfills missing chain
data in `(created_at, id)` order; the recomputation is deterministic, so
restarting with an already complete database performs no writes.

`GET /machines/{machine_id}/authorization-decision-events/integrity` verifies
the chain read-only and returns `{valid, checked_count, broken_event_id}`:
a complete or empty chain reports `true`, the total count, and `null`;
otherwise it reports `false`, the total count, and the first event whose
content hash, link, or chain hash does not verify. A missing machine returns
`404 not_found`.

## Bounded causal traces

`GET /machines/{machine_id}/authorization-decision-events/{event_id}/causal-trace`
runs a read-only, bounded trace over the causal links created via the
causal-links endpoints. Both query parameters are required and validated
before any lookup, so any missing or invalid parameter returns `422`:

- `direction` — exactly `downstream` (existing `cause_event_id` to
  `effect_event_id`) or `upstream` (the reverse);
- `max_depth` — an integer from `1` to `20`. Boolean strings (`true`,
  `false`) and non-integer forms (`1.5`, `3.0`) are rejected.

After validation, the start event must exist and belong to `machine_id`;
otherwise the endpoint returns `404 {"error":{"code":"not_found"}}`.

The response is `{event_id, direction, max_depth, events}`. Each entry in
`events` is `{event_id, depth}` for an event reachable within `max_depth`
edges: the start event is never included, an event reachable by several paths
appears once at its smallest depth, and entries are ordered by `depth`
ascending, then by event `created_at` and `id`. The traversal stays inside the
machine, ignores links whose target event no longer exists, terminates even
when links form a cycle, and returns an empty array when nothing is
reachable. The query never writes or modifies any record.
